# CLtracEr
tracEr with OpenCL in C

Currently implemented CPU side only, running on one thread

Completely self contained, with no libraries

Supports diffuse, glossy, and transmissive shaders

Currently only supports spheres, and does not have BVH support


# Improvements over original tracEr:
Massively simplified and removes all objects and polymorphism

Transmissive Shaders

# Future Plans:
BVH

Triangle Intersections (this one is quick)

Image textures

Photon Mapping 

Connect to an OpenGL window so you can move around
  *This does not support interaction (as photon mapping/bvh is static) but you can move around
